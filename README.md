I am a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the University of Auckland, under the supervision of Professors [Claire](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/c-postlethwaite) [Postlethwaite](https://sites.google.com/view/clairepostlethwaite) and [Vivien Kirk](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/v-kirk). I am interested in the mathematical theory of dynamical systems, and my thesis is about dynamics near structures known as *heteroclinic networks*.
